Oh man, just stepped out of Becoming Led Zeppelin and my brain's still rattling like a loose overhead bin. It’s like they took the pure chaos of turbulence and turned it into a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. Or maybe I’m just still feeling the backache from the damn theater seat! You ever sit on one of those seats that feel like they’re made of leftover airplane metal? Anyway...  

Jimmy Page’s guitar sounds are still ringing in my ears, like when a baby cries for nine hours straight on a transatlantic. The montage with Galadriel’s eyes cut through scenes, why was she there? Popcorn crumbs everywhere, sticking to my fingers like that epic Stairway riff sticks in your head. My mind is jumping from one scene to another, couldn’t hold onto anything solid like trying to serve coffee in mid-flight bumps.

> And Bonham, holy cow! The guy could drum like a thunderstorm you see from the cockpit window at 30,000 feet — you know it's far away but you still feel it under your skin. Wish someone had told me not to finish that whole Large Coke before it started, had to waddle like a penguin to the restroom twice.

Remember how you said you wanted to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Honestly, I’d 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to piece it all together, feel it settle in, like how you rearrange luggage for balance. Robert Plant’s voice melted me away, somewhere between wanting to cry and laugh, kinda like when you hear some gossip about a passenger that makes no sense but is sooo juicy. 

And the theater noise — people, popcorn munching, the rustle of jackets — was like background chatter in the terminal. Ran into an old colleague from the Atlanta route at the concession stand just before it started. Weird, ey? Mind’s trailing off again.

if (ledZeppelin == awesome) {
   printf(Mind's blown, diluted in musical genius.
);
  } else {
   printf(Still reeling from   turbulence...
);
} 

Yeah, that’s about it.
